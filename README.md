# React useEffect Hook Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the React `useEffect` hook. The `useEffect` hook, when used with an empty dependency array (`[]`), is expected to run only once after the initial render.  However, under certain circumstances (often related to other state changes or asynchronous operations outside the direct control of the component), it can run more frequently than anticipated. This can lead to performance issues and unexpected side effects.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when the useEffect hook runs repeatedly even though the dependency array is empty. This violates the intended behavior and results in unnecessary re-renders and potential performance problems.

## Solution

The provided solution demonstrates one approach to rectify the issue. However, it depends on the context of the bug and often requires careful review of external dependencies and state management techniques within the affected component.
